<h3 id="architecture-history">Architecture History</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the very first architecture frameworks was Zachmann Framework, which came out in 1987. in IBM . People took the Zachman framework and started to adjust it, based on their organization&rsquo;s needs and personality.</li>
<li>But an architecture is not a framework. Rather, an architecture, is the end result of a framework.</li>
<li>The ISO has documented over 67 different architecture frameworks.The most welll-known one is The Open Group Architecture Forum (TOGAF).
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The problem with TOGAF is that it was created before the concept of security architecture was conceived. As a result, it doesn&rsquo;t take into consideration how to deal with security risk.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) is a framework that took components of TOGAF and Zachman&rsquo;s to create a uniquely security-based architecture framework. SABSA started in 2007 and has been growing ever since.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>From a security point of view, SABSA works very well. Unfortunately, it is just about security and it isn&rsquo;t something that is widely adopted among an entire IT organization.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

</ul>
<h3 id="security-architecture">Security Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>a security architect is an architect that specializes in security, not a security person
who can do design. This is a very important distinction.</strong></li>
</ul>

<li>Operations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-different-security-architecture-roles">The different security architecture roles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise security architects:
<strong>deal more with the strategy and program management layer.</strong></li>
<li>Solution security architects:
<strong>focus of projects</strong></li>
<li>Security engineers:
<strong>technical architect,focuses on the technology for
implementing the technology.</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Understand that security is not the core business</li>
<li>Understand and mitigate risk</li>
<li>Communication is key to success</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t preach</li>
<li>All solutions are a combination of technology, people, and processes</li>
<li>Governance drives what must be done, not personal opinion</li>
<li>Repeat back to your stakeholders what you are hearing in your own words</li>
<li></li>

<li><strong>Talk to people.
Consolidate what you hear.
Feed it back to them for correction.
Finalize and communicate.</strong></li>
<li>the length of the principles. if they are too long, people won&rsquo;t read them or bother to reference them.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sample-security-architecture-principles">Sample security architecture principles</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Principles should be very simple to read and understand, and shouldn&rsquo;t be more than one sentence in <strong>length</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to remember that solutions deal with
three or four core components. Most architects will tell you that these components are <strong>people, process, and technology</strong>. I believe that there is actually a fourth component: <strong>governance</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People</p>
<ol>
<li>Questions
<ul>
<li>Who are your primary stakeholders going to be?</li>
<li>Who is ultimately responsible for security architecture? Sure, you may be creating it, but is it owned by the CISO or the Chief Architect, or someoneelse?</li>
<li>How do your customers fit into it? Who are your customers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Principles
<ul>
<li>All security architecture is owned by the Chief Architect with input from the CISO</li>
<li>We view our customers as the end users of any system we are designing for</li>
<li>We will always take into consideration the requirements of the sustainment teams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>the process component</p>
<ol>
<li>Questions
<ul>
<li>What framework will you be following in developing your architectures?</li>
<li>Is there a focus that you will have from the outset of your design efforts?</li>
<li>Are you looking for a speedy implementation or will you be looking to balance the business needs with risk?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Principles
<ul>
<li>We will use comprehensive architectural planning based on the TOGAF framework</li>
<li>We will focus on enterprise-wide solutions rather than local solutions that are enhanced for specific business groups</li>
<li>We will carefully balance the business need to quickly offer new products against the security risks it might pose to our customers, company brand, or employees</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology</p>
<ol>
<li>Questions
<ul>
<li>Are you comfortable with bleeding edge technology or do you want to be looking at more stable solutions?</li>
<li>How are you going to look at refreshing the environment? Are you going to be driven by business need, or are you going to be driven by architectural
risk?</li>
<li>Will you take solutions from the various business groups that may have been sold the shiny new object, or are you going to push solutions back to the business groups?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Principles
<ul>
<li>We will adopt proven security technologies that will protect our company and customers. To that end, we want to see examples of the technology in use within our industry.</li>
<li>Solutions will be driven based on requirements gathered first. We will view any product-based solution that hasn&rsquo;t had requirements collected first as a flawed solution to be rejected out of hand.</li>
<li>We will take a Best Suite of Products approach rather than a Best of Breed approach to allow for a more efficient management of assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governance</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some people think of governance as just another process but you can&rsquo;t call a policy and standard a process. They are artifacts.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Questions
<ul>
<li>How are you going to measure what you have accomplished? Are you meeting the requirements of your organization?</li>
<li>Is there a way you want to make sure the security architectures are meeting the needs of the business?</li>
<li>Who has oversight over all security architecture?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Principles
<ul>
<li>We will benchmark ourselves against other organizations in our industry.
We want to be in the top quartile in stakeholder satisfaction.</li>
<li>All solutions will be reviewed by stakeholders after requirements have beengathered, designs have been put together, and the build environments have been implemented.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were to limit yourself to 10 principles, you could put all these principles onto one sheet of paper and hand it to any new employee for them to post on their cubicle wall.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-policies-and-standards">Security Policies and Standards</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Policies</p>
<p><strong>policies are stances that indicate the intent or goal of what an organization is aiming for.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures</p>
<p><strong>Procedures are the methods that are used to implement the policies.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standards</p>
<p><strong>Standards are measuring sticks that are used to compare where an organization is in an area compared to where they want to be.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy development process</p>
<p>The best solution for this is a series of workshops that are done in several stages. They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Interview individual stakeholders</p>
<p>The best way to start the entire process is to interview each stakeholder individually</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agree upon areas for policy development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussion of the different options within individual policies and the
selection of policy requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review of draft policy documents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final sign-off of policy documents</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The policy document</p>
<p>The ideal case is that the policy or standard is no longer than two pages. Any longer and you are not clearly
communicating direction.</p>
<p><strong>a good template to use for the creation of a policy</strong></p>
<blockquote>

  The purpose of this policy is to &lt;REASON FOR POLICY&gt; .

</li>
<li>
<p>Language of policies</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another common problem that people make when writing a policy document is that they mix up the wording used in policies with those used in procedures. Procedures are used to explain how to do something, whereas policies are used to say what the end result must be. Two completely different purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The other thing to remember when writing a policy is that you want to be as independent of specific technologies as possible. Because the IT industry
changes so much, it is important that policies not refer to specific technologies.</p>

<p>Security policy and standard areas</p>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Each section of the SAG should have requirements stated. Address these requirements as follows:

1. As part of the business requirement documentation activities, you need to gather the appropriate requirements for your project. Collect the appropriate
standards for the project and add your security requirements.
2. Use the requirements to put in the appropriate security controls in your Architecture Design Document (ADD). It will help in making sure your solution has the appropriate level of security applied.

<p>Design Rule #1: When you design your network zones, always logically group your devices based on security classification. Don&rsquo;t intermix them.
Design Rule #2: When you design your network zones, always have your traffic initialize in a higher-security zone and go to a lower-security zone. Do not let traffic be initialized from a lower zone and go to a higher zone.</p>

<p>Design rule #3: Make sure that the scanning solution isn&rsquo;t scanning through a firewall. Otherwise, you may not see all the configuration elements of your targets and you&rsquo;ll also load up your firewall with traffic.

<p>users should avoid clicking on links sent to them by strangers via email. They should also be cautious when downloading email attachments sent by unknown people or emails from people in their contact lists that seem strange. It is also advisable for users to avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots since malware can easily traverse a network and infect computers connected to it if there is one infected computer in the network. Host-based firewalls can also come in handy to prevent browsers from opening known malicious sites. Users should also keep updated antivirus programs running on their computers to prevent viruses from taking over their machines if they manage to enter. In extreme cases where a computer has been overrun by a virus, the best option is to wipe out the entire hard disk through formatting and then installing a new OS.</p>
